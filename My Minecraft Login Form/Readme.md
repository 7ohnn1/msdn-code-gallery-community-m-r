## Description

<h1>This is my Minecraft Login Form for anyone who loves Minecraft and programming with Windows Forms Application with Visual Studio. This is just a simple example to show you how easy it is to create a Windows Application Login Form. This example is a C# program,
 so it requires Visual Studio(2013 and later) with .NET Framework 4.5.2 and later .NET Frameworks and SDKs. This example includes 2 Forms, a form to fill in the login info, the other form shows you how to open Minecraft or even another programmes (if you like)
 (in my computer ;D) and a button to close the second form. And of course you can go to the Text property of the label in the second form to change the directory of the Minecraft Launcher. Good luck and hopefully you can run this program successfully on your
 computer (Visual Studio Community 2017 and Windows 10 Anniversary Update (minimum operating system) and at least 4 GB of RAM plus to&nbsp;NVIDIA 1080<strong></strong><em></em> chip and a lot of hard drive memory (or an another storage device) is recommend
 because it's the version/operating system/hardware that I use on my Windows 10 Creators Update computer ! :D). The password to extract is LeQuangDat or Windows 10 Mobile<span>. Thank you for downloading this sample!</span></h1>
