## Description

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Prism includes a sample called a reference implementation, which is a composite application that is based on a real-world scenario. This intentionally incomplete application illustrates the composite application baseline architecture. Within the application,
 you will see solutions for common and recurrent challenges that developers face when creating composite applications. We solve many of the challenges using design patterns such as Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), Composite View, Event Aggregator, Plug-In, and
 Dependency Injection that embody important architectural design principles such as separation of concerns and loose coupling. Prism helps you to create a modular application design and build applications using loosely coupled components that can evolve independently
 but that can be easily and seamlessly integrated into the overall application.</p>
<p>The reference implementation is not a real-world application; however, it is based on real-world challenges customers are facing. When you look at this application, do not look at it as a reference point for building a stock trader application&mdash;instead,
 look at is as a reference for building a composite application.&nbsp;</p>
