<h1>Microsoft Azure QuickStarts</h1>
<p>This sample pack contains a collection of simple applications designed to help developers accomplish key scenarios with Microsoft Azure using the .NET SDK. Each sample covers a specific Azure technology, such as Blob Storage, Media Services or DocumentDB.
 The samples are intended to show the most common tasks relevant to each technology and do not attempt to comprehensively demonstrate everything that you may need. For complete details on each technology and the available features, please follow the links to
 the documentation pages that are included with each sample. </p>
<p>To run these samples, you'll need to have a Microsoft Azure subscription, Visual Studio, and the

<b>New Project</b> dialog, under Templates \ Visual C# \ Cloud \ QuickStarts. </p>
